# Numerical_analysis

This repository contains code implementations of various numerical methods used in numerical analysis. The codes are designed to solve problems related to integral approximation, interpolation, root finding, solving differential equations, and other numerical techniques.


## Introduction
Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that focuses on developing and implementing algorithms for solving mathematical problems using numerical approximation techniques. This repository aims to provide implementations of common numerical methods to address problems such as integral approximation, interpolation, root finding, and solving differential equations.

## Implemented Methods
The repository currently includes code implementations for the following numerical methods:

1. **Numerical Integration**: Approximating definite integrals using techniques such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and numerical quadrature methods.
2. **Interpolation**: Constructing functions that approximate data points between known data points using methods like Lagrange interpolation and Newton interpolation.
3. **Root Finding**: Finding the roots of equations using iterative methods like the bisection method, Newton's method, and the secant method.
4. **Differential Equation Solving**: Solving ordinary differential equations using numerical methods like Euler's method, the Runge-Kutta method, and the finite difference method.
